        <p>Hey</p>
        <p>
            Today marks the 5th anniversary of the Critical Book Reviews website. When I started this site back in Jan 1, 2019, I was hopeful for 
a new effort I'd made using my existing knowledge and interests. I'd sworn to keep this maintained and developed further over the coming
years. After 5 years, this site has taught me a lot, and made what was once a never-existent hobby to something I cannot live without
doing, something which now has transformed into a subsconscious process whenever I consume a piece of art. It's an opportunity to be
grateful for, the mere presence of a drive that gave my pen words, to keep up with time a style continually improving, thanks to
ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope this site has given something to you as well, and you shared with all those articles a part which resonates in both of us.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope it gave you an idea of the themes of the works considered, from my point of view. It is regretful that posts couldn't be posted
ever so frequently, but I feel it had its own intent, I have focused more on the structure and content which I express, it has helped
me keep on doing what I did using just ink and paper. With upcoming posts, I hope you see that as well, and with feedback, we could
keep up a foistering shell out here.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next year sees a crucial point for the website, as we start to include movies as well. It feels a continuation from the
interconnection one could always see between forms of art.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Wishing a great new year ahead,<br>Aadithya Varma</p>
